# R2D2

This repository is to organize my hardware and software files for my styrene R2D2 project. Currently most of the files are still in very early stages of development and yet unpublished.

## Background:
The structural hardware is based on the eggcrate styrene frame by [Frank Pirz](http://www.r2d2.media-conversions.net/). Frank did an amazing job in developing a design for a frame that is easy to assemble by having the parts slide into each other with appropriate slots. These slots were however designed for imperial measurements.

Trying those on 3mm styrene sheets instead of 1/8th of an inch showed to be a bit loose:

What you see is two pieces of 3mm styrene with 1/8th inch slots. There is visible deflection and the connection was very loose. After seeing this, I decided to modify all of Frank's files to have 3mm slots to give a tighter connection to ease assembly and gluing.

## Current status:
After a two-year break of working on R2 I plan to start again. For the moment I will re-organize my work a bit and focus on the dome for the time being

Regarding the frame I contemplate switching to the updated CS:R design of R2. I already have some frame parts finished and also spent considerable time to turn Frank's design into metric, but the CS:R frame is more advanced and more accurate.



## Plans for the future:

* construct 3d model of the dome
* design and test 3d-printable dome hinges
* develop code for logic engines
* finalize metric version of Frank's plans
* add 232 functionality
* hardware and software designs for PSIs and logic displays
* actuation of all panels
* ...
