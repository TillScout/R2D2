This folder contains the design files for the frame of the droid. There are two versions of the frame: A metric version of the original frame design by Frank Pirz and a version modified by me that has a maintenance hatch at the back of the droid. I decided to go with a hatch at the back to be able to access the internals of the droid.

This is the BOM for the frame:

|Description   	|Filename   	| styrene thickness |Number of pieces   	|Finished pieces    	| remark |
|---	|---	|---	|---	|--- |

|Ring 2   	|`ring2 door.dxf` |3mm  	|1   	|   	| |
|Ring 3   	|`ring3 door.dxf` |3mm  	|1  	|1   	| contains four pieces |
|Ring 4   	|`ring4 door.dxf` |3mm  	| 1  	|   	|   |
