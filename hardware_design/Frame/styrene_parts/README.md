This folder contains the design files for the frame of the droid. There are two versions of the frame: A metric version of the original frame design by Frank Pirz and a version modified by me that has a maintenance hatch at the back of the droid. I decided to go with a hatch at the back to be able to access the internals of the droid.

This is the BOM for the frame:
